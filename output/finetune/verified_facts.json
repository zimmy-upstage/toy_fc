        "confidence": 1.0,
        "explanation": "The claimed fact states that fine-tuned models are always perfect and outperform other methods, which is an unrealistic assertion. Fine-tuning improves models, but they are not perfect, and their performance depends on various factors, such as the quality of the fine-tuning process and the specific task."

        "confidence": "0.95",
        "explanation": "While alignment tuning aims to align model outputs with human values and preferences, it does not guarantee perfect reflection in every scenario due to potential limitations in defining and capturing all human values and contexts."

        "confidence": "0.9",
        "explanation": "The claimed fact aligns with the provided knowledge graph, as 'Alignment Tuning' is mentioned to train a model to follow tasks described in natural language and align outputs with human values and preferences. However, the claim lacks clarity on the specific techniques used in alignment tuning and potential limitations, justifying a confidence score of 0.9."

        "explanation": "The claimed fact accurately describes instruction tuning as training the model to follow tasks described in natural language, making it capable of handling various requests and commands. This is confirmed by the knowledge graph's definition and comparison to teaching the model new skills."

        "explanation": "The knowledge graph directly supports the claim, defining instruction tuning as teaching LLMs to understand and execute specific instructions, akin to teaching the model new skills. It also specifies training the model to follow tasks described in natural language, further confirming the alignment with the claim."
